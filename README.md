# Arduino-real-time-clock-with-alarm
In this project, we will make a digital alarm clock using the Arduino, and this clock has the advantage of keeping time even without an external source of power, meaning that even if you disconnect the Arduino from the power source (such as the battery), you will not need to reset the timing or reprogramming later after returning the power source.

In this project, we will rely on the DS1307 RTC module, as the latter will perform all the tasks of keeping time, while the battery that will be connected with this integrated circuit will be separate and have nothing to do with the main source of power.
